Hibernate is  Java EE framework, empowers managing  database interactions, simplifying the persistence layer and enabling seamless integration of Java applications with relational databases
During the Hibernate lab work, I worked on several cases related to Object-Relational Mapping with Hibernate
# Exercise 1
I have a single 'Product' entity in which we performed various operations using the implemented methods from the 'IDao' layer."
Here is the database design

 # Exercise 2
 This project consists of two layers - the Persistence Layer and the Service Layer
 
 -Persistence Layer
 
 Develop entity classes in the 'ma.projet.classes' package.
 Create the Hibernate configuration file 'hibernate.cfg.xml' in the 'ma.projet.config' package.
 Create the 'HibernateUtil' class in the 'ma.projet.util' package.
 
 -Service Layer
 
 Create the generic 'IDao' interface in the 'ma.projet.dao' package.
 Create service classes which implement the 'IDao' interface in the 'ma.projet.service' package.
 Implement methods for displaying various function such as product lists by category, products 
 ordered between specific dates and products with a price higher than 100
